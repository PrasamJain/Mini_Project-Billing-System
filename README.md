                                In this repo, We can create a Billing System ( for Bar ) using Python Graphics (Tkinter).  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that’s built into the Python standard library. 
Tkinter has several strengths. It’s cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

However, Tkinter is lightweight and relatively painless to use compared to other frameworks. 
This makes it a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, 
especially for applications where a modern sheen is unnecessary, and the top priority is to quickly build something that’s functional and cross-platform.

In this repo, you’ll learn how to:

                                      Get started with Tkinter with its application.
                                      Work with widgets, such as buttons and text boxes.
                                      Control your application layout with geometry managers.
                                      Make your applications interactive by associating button clicks with Python functions.
                                      And last, we Building our Python GUI Application With Tkinter which is Known as " BILLING SYSTEM".

* A billing system is the process by which a business bills and invoices customers. 
* Billing systems often include payment software that automates the process of collecting payments, sending out recurring invoices, and invoice tracking.
* We can create a Billing System for a BAR Known as " Prism BAR " using GUI Python.
* For this, we import some pictures and use inside our bar-billing system.
